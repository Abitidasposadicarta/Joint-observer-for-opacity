# Joint-observer-for-opacity
The computation of a joint observer to realize current-state opcity enforcement
Just run the document comp.m the code by MATLAB.
The user should intput an automaton (G), the set of observable events by intruder (eint(, the set of observable events by operator (eope), secret set (s), the set of eraseable events (eera), and the set of insertable events (eins)
The form of automaton is as follows: (q1,e,12) means the firing of e at q1 can lead to q2. All states and events should be encoded to integer number.
The specific information can be seen in the dialong box.
